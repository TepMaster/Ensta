Ensta uses Instagram's Internal Web API for data scraping which makes it a reliable choice over other third-party libraries. Also unlike other libraries, ensta always remains up-to-date.

Two type of classes are supported - ***Guest & Host***.

## üßîüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Host Mode
Requires login through Username/Password or SessionId. Can be used to fetch data that requires login as well as update your own profile.

Example:

```python
from ensta import Host

host = Host(username, password)

print(host.follow("leomessi"))
print(host.unfollow("leomessi"))
print(host.profile("leomessi"))
```

## üßîüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Guest Mode
Doesn't require login but is limited to certain actions.

Example:

```python
from ensta import Guest

guest = Guest()
print(guest.profile("leomessi"))
```

### Code Samples:
1. **Fetch Followers / Followings List**
    ```python
    from ensta import Host

    host = Host("username", "password")
   
    followers = host.followers("cristiano")
    followings = host.followings("cristiano")

    for user in followers: print(user.username)
    for user in followings: print(user.username)
    ```

3. **Follow / Unfollow People**
